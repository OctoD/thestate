Rescript module template
========================

- It's Rescript! ❤️
- Builds fast
- Generates `.d.ts` files using gentype
- Builds both to commonjs and es6 spec

## scripts

# Build

Builds files, generates typings and copy all necessaries files into the lib dir (ready to be published on a registry)

```
npm run build
```


# Watch

If you are using the rescript lang plugin for vscode, it adds intellisense and other beautiful stuff in realtime inside your editor. Oh, builds files too (but not ready to be published on a registry)

```
npm run watch
```
